Subjective quality assessment - IVC database


The purpose of this page is to make available the subjective quality assessment IVC database.
The experiments were conducted in our lab in normalized conditions.

10 original images were used, 235 distorted images were generated from 4 different processing :

    * JPEG,
    * JPEG2000,
    * LAR coding and
    * Blurring.


These algorithms have the advantage to generate very different type of distortions.

Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) method with 5 categories and 15 observers.

Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimised in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale.

A Microsoft excel worksheet, giving all subjective quality scores is included in the above archive.


This database was used in
